Easily customise and embed the windy.com widget as a native WordPress widget or shortcode.

== Description ==
Ventus allows you to easily embed the [windy.com](https://www.windy.com) widget on your website, in the form of a native WordPress widget (accessible from Appearance > Widgets) or as a simple shortcode. 

It is a lightweight plugin built using an object-oriented approach, and follows [Wordpress Coding Standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards).

= Features =
* Set the overlay to either clouds, CO concentration, radar/lightning, rain, sea temperature, snow cover, standard temperature, waves, or wind.
* Use either Celsius or Fahrenheit as the temperature scale.
* Set the width, height and border-radius using responsive (%) and/or fixed (px) values.
* Manually define longitude and latitude for precise location coordinates.
* Choose from 8 levels of zoom (min. 3, max. 11).
* Show or hide pressure isolines, the map marker and spot forecast.
* Choose from the following wind measurement units: beaufort (bft), kilometers per hour (km/h), knots (kt), meters per second (m/s) and miles per hour (mph).

= Shortcodes =
The shortcode accepts up to 13 attributes. You can simply use `[ventus]` and it will work (or the old shortcode `[weather-map]` which will continue to work), but you will most likely want to customise the remaining attributes yourself.

An example of a fully filled-out shortcode would be:

`[ventus width="100%" height="350px" radius="20px" loading="lazy" lat="53.199" lon="-7.603" zoom="4" layer="wind" scale="C" units="knots" pressure="true"  marker="true" forecast="true" time="12"]`. 

The attributes can be set as follows:

* The `width` attribute accepts any valid CSS property for width.
* The `height` attribute accepts any valid CSS property for height.
* The `radius` attribute accepts any valid CSS property for border-radius.
* The `loading` attribute accepts either lazy or eager. The default is lazy loading.
* The `lat` attribute must contain a string of digits to three decimal places, in the range of -90 to +90 (e.g. "53.199"). 
* The `lon` attribute must also contain a string of digits to three decimal places, in the range of -180 to +180 (e.g. "-120.894"). 
* The `zoom` attribute must contain a number between 3 and 11 (inclusive).
* The `layer` attribute accepts the following values: clouds, cosc (CO concentration), radar, rain, snowcover, sst (sea temperature), temp (standard temperature), waves and wind.
* The `scale` attribute accepts either "C" or "F", defining Celsius and Fahrenheit respectively.
* The `units` attribute accepts the following values: bft (beaufort), km/h (kilometers per hour), kt (knots), m/s (meters per second) and mph (miles per hour).
* The `pressure` attribute can be set to true to display pressure isolines, otherwise the isolines will remain hidden.
* The `marker` attribute can also be set to true, otherwise it will remain hidden.
* The `forecast` attribute can be set to true to display the spot forecast, otherwise it will remain hidden.
* The `time` attribute accepts the following values: now (the default), 12 (12 hours from now) and 24 (24 hours from now).

Note that in the case of an invalid value, a default value will be used instead.

== Installation ==
1. No special set-up required - just click install and activate, and you're good to go!
2. If you manually download the plugin, just unzip to the WordPress plugins folder and the plugin will be automatically detected. It can then be activated as normal.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why is the map showing the wrong location? =
This can happen sometimes with the shortcode if you wrap the longitude or latitude attributes in the wrong kind of quote marks.

Mark sure you are using `" "` rather than `” ”`, e.g.

Correct: `lat="44.096"`
Incorrect: `lat=”44.096”`

= How do I set the latitude and longitude?

The easiest (and recommended) way to do this is to go straight to [windy.com](https://www.windy.com). Once there, take note of the URL. It will contain the latitude and longitude in its parameters, and if you zoom in, it will also contain the zoom level. For example, the sample parameters I use as defaults are: latitude 53.199, longitude -7.603, and a zoom level of 5. These would show in the URL in the following format: [windy.com/?53.199,-7.603,5](https://www.windy.com).

= Why not just embed the iframe directly from [windy.com](https://www.windy.com) instead of using this plugin? =

If you'd prefer to do this, that's great - no problem! However, this plugin was created to make the iframe that [windy.com](https://www.windy.com) kindly provide even more useful. To that end, it offers the following advantages:

* While an iframe can be inserted directly into a page or post, you can't insert an iframe directly into the WordPress widgets area (which is how most themes allow you to set the content for site sidebars and footers etc). This plugin allows you to do precisely that.
* And even in the case of an iframe inserted into a page or post, the generated code can often confuse people who don't have any technical/programming experience. The shortcode provided by this plugin simplifies this considerably, making it readable and easy to customise by anyone.
* You can change the default overlay from wind to either clouds, CO concentration, sea temperature, snow cover, standard temperature, radar/lightning, rain, or waves.
* Width and height can be set to responsive (percentage-based) as well as fixed (pixel-based) values.
